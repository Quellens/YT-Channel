There is my first website and my Game "Riggler Scud"
Riggler Scud is a mini-game/browser-game where your reaction speed is required. It was made for a Nintendo-Youtuber DÃ¤vid (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUrpHdGecz7NS8jpvFOTwSg)
It is a new version of my old game 'Rounded Leap'. The word "Scud" means as much as hunting/running/bailing. In this version, you have to run from the #Riggler, which forms after an explosion, like normal worms do. You are a white, appetizing piece of the riggler and have to eat the #Popkorn555 bags to heal yourself. That's too rild what's happening. When you turn blue, it means you've reached maximum speed. You and the riggler aren't going any faster. There are 3 levels of difficulty in which you can play. 
With "Easy" you can go through the edges and get out on the opposite side. 
"Neutral" is the new normal. With "Neutral" there is no such teleportation.
With the difficulty level "heftig" black holes are a danger in addition to the riggler, in which you die immediately. Plus the riggler has become fatter.
Each difficulty level has its own music. Here you can find the music if you want to listen to it.
